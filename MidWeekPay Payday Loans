MidWeekPay Payday Loans

Installment lenders provide access to credit for borrowers with subprime credit scores, most of whom have low to moderate incomes and some traditional banking or credit experience, but might not qualify for conventional loans or credit cards. Like payday lenders, consumer finance companies operate under state laws that typically regulate loan sizes, interest rates, finance charges, loan terms, and any additional fees. But installment lenders do not require access to borrowersâ€™ checking accounts as a condition of credit or repayment of the full amount after two weeks, and their prices are not as high. Instead, although statutory rates and other rules vary by state, these loans are generally repayable in four to 60 substantially equal monthly installments that average approximately $120 and are issued at retail branches.
